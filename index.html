                <p>Atari (/əˈtɑːri/) is a brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by
                    French publisher Atari SA, through a subsidiary named Atari Interactive. The original
                    Atari, Inc., founded in Sunnyvale, California, in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, was a
                    pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such
                    as Pong and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to
                    the mid-1980s.</p>

                <p> 1984, as a result of the video game crash of 1983, the home console and computer divisions of the
                    original Atari Inc. were sold off, and the company was renamed Atari Games Inc.[4] Atari Games
                    received the rights to use the logo and brand name with appended text "Games" on arcade games, as
                    well as rights to the original 1972–1984 arcade hardware properties. The Atari Consumer Electronics
                    Division properties were in turn sold to Jack Tramiel's Tramel Technology Ltd., which then renamed
                    itself to Atari Corporation. In 1996, Atari Corporation reverse-merged with disk-drive
                    manufacturer JT Storage (JTS), becoming a division within the company. In 1998, Hasbro
                    Interactive acquired all Atari Corporation related properties from JTS, creating a new
                    subsidiary, Atari Interactive.</p>

                    The Atari 2600, branded as the Atari Video Computer System (Atari VCS) until November 1982, is a
                    home video game console developed and produced by Atari, Inc. Released in September 1977, it
                    popularized the use of microprocessor-based hardware and of games stored on swappable ROM
                    cartridges, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976. The VCS was bundled with two
                    joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge—initially
                    Combat[4] and later Pac-Man.

        when you click the arrow the photos was changing but when i wrote the code here both the first photo and arrows were displayed and when you click the arrows photos were changing. the code was working properly, that's why i wrote the code here  -->
